// 1.Setup default state object. {count: 0}.<Counter /> this component is going to render itself for the very 1st time using those default values.render() gets called, and res shows up to the screen
// 2. Component rendered with default state values*
// 3. Change state(based off of some event(button click)) .(app rerenders itself)Lets say the user click the +1 button,count changes from 0 to 1.handleAddOne(){} this method on class runs, and state changes <Counter/> changes. {count: 2}.
// 4. Component re-rendered using new state values. (app rerenders itself) So it brings the UI up to date with a component state.We don't do anything manually to get that done.We just change the state.Behind the sceenes. React.component API its going to see the state changed,its going to make sure UI gets updated
// 5. Statrt again at 3. When the data {count: 1} changes we want to rerender UI. state is an object.With initial data {count: 0} that gets rendered to the screen.State obj can be changes based off of some interactions like onClick={},or HTTP rreq,when we do change the state app will rerender itself auto
