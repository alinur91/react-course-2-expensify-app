// loader-- lets you custmoize the behaivour of  webpack when it loads a given file
// converting ES6 to ES5 JSX to regular old Javascript
//babel-cli allows you to run babel from comand line and babel-core module allows you
//to run babel from tools like webpack,babel-loader is a webpack plugin,its going to
//allow us to teach webpack how to run babel when webpack sees certaint files
